# Changelog

All notable changes to Telar will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0-beta] - 2026-03-25

A new milestone.

This is Telar's twenty-fourth release. For the first time, Telar can weave together images, video, and audio — a major new stage that we hope will help you tell all sorts of new stories. Together with a fluid scroll engine (no more jumping!), a new card-stack architecture, and the WYSIWYG [Telar Compositor](https://compositor.telar.org), these features round out the roadmap we first sketched when we started building Telar. It finally feels like a 1.0.

None of this would have happened without all of you who tested early versions, reported what was broken, and told us what you needed. Thank you.

— Juan

### Added

- **Video support**: YouTube, Vimeo, and Google Drive videos in stories and on object pages. Clip control (start, end, loop) lets you highlight specific segments

- **Audio support**: Audio files with WaveSurfer waveform visualization in stories and on object pages. Clip regions for selecting segments

- **Clip time picker**: Interactive tool on object pages for setting video and audio clip boundaries. Copy start/end times directly into your spreadsheet

- **Card-stack scroll architecture**: Stories now use a continuous scroll model with magnetic waypoints instead of the previous step-by-step navigation. Cards slide over previous ones, creating a fluid reading experience

- **Media type detection and filtering**: Objects are automatically classified as Image, Video, or Audio. The gallery page has separate type and medium filters

- **Alt text support**: New `alt_text` column in story and object spreadsheets for accessibility descriptions, with automatic fallback to object titles

- **Inline Lucide SVG icons**: All icons are now self-hosted inline SVGs, replacing the Google Material Symbols and Bootstrap Icons CDN dependencies

- **Audio build pipeline**: New `process_audio.py` script for clip extraction and waveform peak data generation, integrated into the local build script and GitHub Actions workflow

### Changed

- **Scroll system**: Replaced the discrete step accumulator with Lenis continuous scroll and magnetic snap waypoints

- **Card rendering**: New per-scene card pool with z-index banding replaces the previous split-column viewer/narrative layout

- **Mobile layout**: Text cards are bottom-anchored on mobile with frosted glass styling

- **Object pages**: Media-type-conditional rendering — images get the IIIF viewer with coordinate panel, videos get embeds with clip picker, audio gets waveform with region-based clip picker

- **Gallery**: Video and audio objects show icon placeholders. Two separate filter sections (Type and Medium/Genre)

- **Viewer preloading**: `max_viewer_cards` default reduced from 10 to 8

### Removed

- **Google Material Symbols CDN dependency**: Replaced by inline Lucide SVGs
- **Bootstrap Icons CDN dependency**: Replaced by inline Lucide SVGs

## [0.9.4-beta] - 2026-03-18

PDF dependency fix.

### Fixed

- **PDF IIIF tile generation in CI**: PyMuPDF was not listed in `requirements.txt`, so CI skipped IIIF tile generation for PDF objects entirely. PDF objects now get tiles generated correctly during builds

## [0.9.3-beta] - 2026-03-14

IIIF bug fixes, multi-page story improvements, and coordinate panel restyle.

### Fixed

- **IIIF crash for small images**: Images smaller than 512px (the tile size) produced an empty `scaleFactors` array in `info.json`, crashing OpenSeadragon/Tify with a `RangeError`. Now defaults to `[1]`

- **IIIF edge tile 404s**: Images larger than 1024px showed 404 errors for edge tiles. The `sizes` array had a single full-resolution entry that caused OpenSeadragon to miscalculate edge tile dimensions

- **IIIF thumbnail generation**: Thumbnails for all scaleFactor levels are now pre-rendered during IIIF generation, and width-only directories from libvips get `{w},{h}` counterparts. Fixes broken homepage and gallery thumbnails

- **Story page switching for multi-page objects**: Navigating between story steps that reference different pages of the same object (e.g. different PDF pages) now correctly loads the new page instead of staying on the original

- **Coordinate finder column order**: Multi-page coordinate copy buttons now output `x,y,zoom,page` to match the spreadsheet column order (was `page,x,y,zoom`)

- **Page column case normalisation**: The `Page` column from Google Sheets (capital P) is now normalised to `page` (lowercase), fixing PDF page-specific manifest loading in stories

- **Page selector truncation**: Fixed Tify 0.35 page selector text being cut off by targeting the renamed `.tify-dropdown-button` class

- **Coordinate panel heading colour**: The panel heading is now explicitly coloured in dark/light variants, overriding the global heading colour rule that made it unreadable on dark theme backgrounds

### Changed

- **Object viewer orientation**: Changed from landscape (fixed 600px height) to portrait (4:5 aspect ratio) on object pages

- **Coordinate panel styling**: Replaced 50+ inline styles with a new SCSS partial (`_coordinate-panel.scss`) using theme-aware colours via CSS custom properties and WCAG luminance detection

- **Coordinate panel internationalisation**: Instructions now use language keys instead of hardcoded English, with a multi-page variant that mentions the Page value

- **Thumbnail size selection**: Homepage and objects gallery now pick the smallest IIIF size >= 400px wide for thumbnails, instead of blindly using the smallest available size

## [0.9.2-beta] - 2026-03-06

IIIF tile rendering fix and workflow cleanup. Thanks to Ashley Vazquez for reporting the Windows rendering issue.

### Fixed

- **IIIF tile rendering on Windows**: Fixed incomplete `sizes` array in `info.json` that caused OpenSeadragon to miscalculate zoom levels and request tiles with negative region coordinates. The `patch_info_json()` function now scans both `w,h` and `w,` (width-only) thumbnail directories generated by libvips. Thanks to Ashley Vazquez for catching this!

- **TIFY 96px thumbnail**: Generate `full/96,/0/default.jpg` thumbnail that TIFY v0.35 hardcodes for its page navigator panel, regardless of IIIF profile level. Previously 404'd on static Level 0 hosting

### Changed

- **Test workflow scoped to main repos**: The Test Telar Scripts workflow now only runs on `UCSB-AMPLab/telar` and `juancobo/telar`, preventing unnecessary CI runs on user sites that inherit the workflow

## [0.9.1-beta] - 2026-03-05

LaTeX math rendering and a file extension bug fix. Thanks to Jaydon Schuler!

### Added

- **LaTeX math rendering (KaTeX)**: Automatic per-page LaTeX detection and rendering using KaTeX 0.16.21. Supports inline math (`$...$`), display math (`$$...$$`), and environments (`\begin{align}`, `\begin{equation}`, etc.). Detection uses smart heuristics to avoid false positives (e.g. `$50` does not trigger math rendering). LaTeX works in story panels, object descriptions, glossary definitions, and custom pages. Sites without LaTeX content have zero overhead -- KaTeX is only loaded on pages that need it

- **Encrypted story LaTeX support**: Stories protected with encryption now support LaTeX. KaTeX loads dynamically after decryption if the story content contains math notation

### Fixed

- **Case-insensitive file extension matching**: Objects with uppercase extensions (e.g. `image.JPG`, `photo.PNG`) no longer trigger false "file missing" warnings during the build or on the site. Extension comparison now uses case-insensitive matching when scanning the objects directory

## [0.9.0-beta] - 2026-03-03

Faster builds, simpler setup, and multi-page document support.

### Added

- **libvips IIIF tile generation**: 28x faster tile generation using libvips as the preferred backend (`vips dzsave --layout iiif3`). Falls back automatically to the Python `iiif` library if the `vips` CLI is not available. GitHub Actions workflow installs `libvips-tools` automatically

- **Tify viewer**: Replaced UniversalViewer with Tify (v0.35.0) across all viewer contexts. Tify uses fewer DOM nodes, provides a Promise-based readiness API, and exposes the OpenSeadragon viewer through a documented public property. All existing viewport coordinates remain compatible

- **PDF document support**: PDF files placed in `telar-content/objects/` are rendered into multi-page IIIF tile pyramids with per-page single-canvas manifests. Requires PyMuPDF (`pip install pymupdf`)

- **Multi-page IIIF support**: Story steps can reference specific pages of multi-page objects using a new `page` column in the story CSV. The coordinate picker on object pages detects multi-page objects, shows pagination controls, and includes the page number in copied coordinates

- **Custom metadata fields**: Extra columns in `objects.csv` beyond the standard fields are now passed through to object pages and rendered in the metadata section. Labels check language keys first, then fall back to the column name with underscores replaced by spaces

- **Trama theme**: New default theme featuring Telar's new visual identity, by Adelaida Ávila. Terracotta links and buttons, lavender layer backgrounds, Space Grotesk headings, Roboto Condensed body text. The Paisajes theme remains available and existing sites keep their configured theme

### Changed

- **Content folder restructure**: `components/` renamed to `telar-content/`, with `images/` renamed to `objects/` (now holds images and PDFs) and `structures/` renamed to `spreadsheets/`. The `telar-` prefix makes the user content directory clearly identifiable. Migration script handles the rename automatically

- **Single Google Sheets URL**: Simplified from requiring both a shared URL and a published URL to using only the published URL. Users no longer need to "Share with link" -- only "Publish to web". If `shared_url` is still present in `_config.yml`, it is silently ignored

## [0.8.1-beta] - 2026-02-26

Onboarding and demo content release with documentation restructure, template simplification, and Spanish-language spreadsheet support.

### Added

- **Spanish-language spreadsheet support**: Google Sheets tabs named `glosario` are now recognized and routed correctly alongside `glossary`. The `instrucciones` tab is also properly skipped during fetch

- **Updated demo content**: Demo bundles now include v0.8.0 metadata fields (year, object_type, subjects, featured, source) so demo objects appear correctly in the gallery filter system

### Changed

- **Google Sheets template simplified**: Reduced from 8 tabs to 6 by removing example story tabs. Users now duplicate `blank_template` / `plantilla_en_blanco` to create new stories

- **Demo object merging**: The demo content system now handles both v0.6.0 bundles (with `medium`, `dimensions`, `location`) and v0.8.0+ bundles (with `year`, `object_type`, `subjects`, `featured`, `source`)

## [0.8.0-beta] - 2026-02-05

Content and access release adding story protection, an enhanced gallery system, and glossary CSV support.

### Added

- **Protected stories**: Stories can now be encrypted with a site-wide key. Add `protected=yes` to a story's row in `project.csv` and set `story_key` in `_config.yml`. Protected stories are encrypted at build time using AES-256-GCM and decrypted in the browser when viewers enter the key. An unlock overlay with session persistence means the key only needs to be entered once per browser session. Share links can optionally include the key for convenient access

- **Browse and search for objects**: The objects page now includes a filter sidebar, full-text search (powered by Lunr.js), and sort controls. Filters use OR within a category and AND across categories. Desktop shows a 250px sidebar on the right; mobile shows a collapsible "Filter by" pill. Disable with `browse_and_search: false` in `_config.yml`

- **Featured objects on homepage**: Optionally display a sample of objects on the homepage with smaller 170px cards. Configure with `show_sample_on_homepage: true` and `featured_count` in `_config.yml`. Objects can be explicitly marked with a `featured` column in `objects.csv`, or selected randomly at build time

- **Glossary CSV support**: Define glossary terms in `components/structures/glossary.csv` as an alternative to individual markdown files. Supports inline definitions and file references. Existing markdown glossaries continue to work unchanged

- **Share panel redesign**: The share panel now uses pill-style tabs ("this story" / "this whole site") with inline copy buttons. For protected stories, a privacy toggle lets you choose whether to include the key in shared links and embed codes, with clear warnings about access implications

### Changed

- **Config setting renames**: `hide_stories` renamed to `skip_stories` and `hide_collections` renamed to `skip_collections` under `development-features`. Old names still work for backward compatibility

- **New config section**: `collection_interface` settings control the objects gallery (browse and search, homepage link, featured objects)

- **Object metadata fields**: Objects CSV now supports `year`, `object_type`, `subjects`, and `featured` columns for richer filtering. The `location` field has been renamed to `source` (old name still supported)

---

**Migration from v0.7.0-beta:**
- Run `python3 scripts/upgrade.py` to upgrade automatically
- **Manual step required**: Copy updated `.github/workflows/build.yml` from the Telar repository (adds search data generation step)
- **For local development**: Install `cryptography` package: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## [0.7.0-beta] - 2026-01-31

Infrastructure and code quality release focusing on maintainability, testing, and accessibility.

### Added

- **Test infrastructure**: Comprehensive automated testing with 305 tests across three frameworks. Python unit tests (235 tests) cover CSV processing, widget parsing, IIIF metadata extraction, and more. JavaScript unit tests (35 tests) verify viewer, navigation, and panel logic. End-to-end tests (35 tests) use Playwright to test story navigation, embed mode, and panel interactions in a real browser

- **Consolidated CI workflow**: Single `telar-tests.yml` workflow runs both Python and JavaScript tests on push/PR. Supports selective test runs via workflow dispatch for faster iteration

- **Dependabot**: Automatic security updates for GitHub Actions dependencies

### Changed

- **Modular Python scripts**: The 2,750-line `csv_to_json.py` is now a 14-module `telar/` package with clear separation of concerns. Each module has a focused purpose: `csv_utils.py` for CSV handling, `widgets.py` for widget parsing, `iiif_metadata.py` for IIIF extraction, etc. The original script remains as a backward-compatible wrapper

- **Modular JavaScript**: The 1,872-line `story.js` is now 6 ES modules bundled by esbuild. `state.js` centralises all mutable state, `navigation.js` handles all navigation modes, `viewer.js` manages IIIF viewer lifecycle, etc. Consolidated 135 lines of duplicated code into shared utilities

- **SCSS partials**: The 3,374-line `telar.scss` is now 9 focused partials in `_sass/`. Reusable mixins for tab colours and viewer hiding reduce duplication. Each partial has a narrative description explaining its purpose

- **Node.js required**: esbuild is now used to bundle JavaScript. Run `npm install` before building locally. The `build_local_site.py` script handles this automatically

### Fixed

- **Accessibility (WCAG AA)**: Fixed colour contrast on intro hints, added navigation landmark for home button, changed story container to semantic `<main>` element. Verified with axe-core accessibility audit

- **Navigation z-index**: Fixed intro step covering navigation buttons when scrolling back from later steps

- **Pandas 3.0 compatibility**: Fixed emoji sanitisation failing on pandas 3.0 due to StringDtype change

---

**Migration from v0.6.3-beta:**
- Run `python3 scripts/upgrade.py` to upgrade automatically
- **Manual step required**: Copy updated GitHub Actions workflows from the Telar repository (build.yml, upgrade.yml, telar-tests.yml)
- **For local development**: Run `npm install` to install esbuild for JavaScript bundling

## [0.6.3-beta] - 2026-01-24

### Added

- **Inline panel content**: Write panel text directly in your spreadsheet instead of creating separate markdown files. Supports three methods: (1) entering text directly in cells, (2) pasting markdown text with optional YAML frontmatter, or (3) referencing external markdown files for complex content. The `layer1_file` column has been renamed to `layer1_content` (old name still works for backward compatibility)

### Changed

- **Column naming**: `layer1_file`, `layer2_file`, `layer3_file` renamed to `layer1_content`, `layer2_content`, `layer3_content` to reflect their expanded purpose. Spanish equivalents: `contenido_capa1`, `contenido_capa2`, `contenido_capa3`. Old column names remain supported for backward compatibility

### Fixed

- **Empty state messages**: Error messages now reference user-editable locations (spreadsheet, `components/` directory) instead of internal Jekyll directories

---

**Migration from v0.6.2-beta:**
- Run `python3 scripts/upgrade.py` to upgrade automatically
- No breaking changes — existing spreadsheets and markdown files work without modification

## [0.6.2-beta] - 2025-12-03

### Added

- **Improved viewer preloading**: Complete overhaul of how Telar loads IIIF viewers eliminates black screens and speeds up navigation. All IIIF manifests are fetched in parallel when the story page loads, so images are ready before you scroll to them. Hovering over a story card on the homepage begins loading its manifests. A subtle shimmer animation shows when a viewer is initializing. Preloading behavior can be tuned via `development-features.viewer_preloading` in `_config.yml`

- **Glossary-to-glossary linking**: You can now use `[[term]]` syntax inside glossary definitions to link to other glossary terms

- **All-in-one build script for local sites**: New `build_local_site.py` runs the complete local build process with a single command. Use `--skip-iiif` for faster rebuilds when images haven't changed, `--skip-fetch` to skip demo content fetching. Serves on port 4001 by default

- **Development feature flags**: New `development-features` section in `_config.yml` with `hide_stories` (temporarily hide stories) and `hide_collections` (hide both objects and stories) for rapid testing

### Fixed

- **Case-insensitive object references**: Object IDs in your story spreadsheet now match regardless of capitalization (e.g., `LEVIATHAN` finds `leviathan`)

- **Case-insensitive file paths**: Markdown file paths work regardless of case, preventing broken links when deploying from Mac to GitHub Pages

- **Index page image overflow**: Large images on the homepage no longer overflow their containers

- **Panel title spacing**: Improved spacing below panel titles for better readability

- **Panel title markup**: Panel titles now use proper `<h1>` elements for accessibility

### Removed

- **Sample glossary entries**: Removed placeholder glossary entries (colonial-period, reduccion, resguardo, viceroyalty, iiif-manifest, markdown) that were not used by the template stories

---

**Migration from v0.6.1-beta:**
- Run `python3 scripts/upgrade.py` to upgrade automatically
- No breaking changes

## [0.6.1-beta] - 2025-11-28

### Added

- **Bilingual README**: Framework README now includes both English and Spanish versions in a single file. Streamlined content removes duplication and directs users to comprehensive documentation at telar.org

### Fixed

- **EXIF orientation in thumbnails**: Fixed thumbnails displaying sideways/upside-down for smartphone photos with EXIF rotation metadata. The IIIF tile generator now correctly detects and applies all EXIF orientations (90°, 180°, 270°). Regenerate IIIF tiles to see correctly oriented thumbnails: `python3 scripts/generate_iiif.py`
- **Migration script template pollution**: Fixed v0.5.0→v0.6.0 migration adding unwanted template files to existing sites. The migration now only adds templates (`your-story/`, `tu-historia/`, demo glossary) to new sites without custom content

## [0.6.0-beta] - 2025-11-28

### Added

#### External Demo Content System
- **Demo content fetching**: New `include_demo_content` configuration option in `_config.yml` allows sites to optionally fetch versioned, multilingual demo content from content.telar.org
- **Automatic demo integration**: Demo stories and glossary entries are automatically merged with your content during the build process
- **Smart cleanup**: Template now ships without bundled demo content - fetch only when needed
- **Bilingual demos**: Demo content adapts to your site language (English or Spanish)
- **Version matching**: Fetches highest compatible demo version for your site

#### Custom Pages System
- **User-editable pages**: Create custom pages in `components/texts/pages/` directory (about, contact, etc.)
- **Configurable navigation menu**: Edit menu items via `_data/navigation.yml` with bilingual support
- **Full Telar features**: Widgets and glossary links work on custom pages
- **Responsive layout**: New `user-page.html` layout provides centered, mobile-friendly content

#### New Telar Website and Documentation
- **New home: telar.org**: Unified website with landing page, documentation, and demo content hosting
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Complete documentation site at telar.org/docs (English) and telar.org/guia (Spanish)
- **Version callouts**: Documentation clearly indicates which features require v0.6.0+
- **Improved structure**: Documentation reorganized with dedicated developer section (Section 8)
- **Backwards-compatible redirects**: Old ampl.clair.ucsb.edu/telar-docs URLs redirect to telar.org/docs

#### Story ID Support (Quality of Life)
- **Semantic story names**: Optional `story_id` column in `project.csv` enables custom story identifiers like "your-story" or "colonial-maps"
- **Better organization**: Story filenames and tab names match your chosen identifiers exactly
- **Fully backward compatible**: Falls back to numbered stories (`story-1`, `story-2`) when `story_id` not provided
- **Automatic discovery**: Scripts process all story CSVs automatically

#### Bilingual CSV Support (Quality of Life)
- **Spanish column headers**: Use Spanish headers in your CSVs (`paso`, `objeto`, `pregunta`, `respuesta`, etc.)
- **Dual header rows**: Support for bilingual header rows with automatic detection
- **Spanish filenames**: Support for Spanish CSV filenames (`proyecto.csv`, `objetos.csv`) with fallback to English
- **Spanish Google Sheets tabs**: Automatically detects Spanish tab names in Google Sheets
- **Fully backward compatible**: English-only CSVs work exactly as before

#### Object Credits Badge
- **Visible attribution**: New dismissable badge displays object credits in bottom-left corner of viewer
- **Configurable**: Enable/disable via `show_object_credits` in `_config.yml`
- **Bilingual**: Supports English "Credit:" and Spanish "Crédito:" prefixes
- **Respectful design**: Matches step number badge styling with subtle transparency

### Fixed

#### Panel Freeze System (Major UX Improvement)
- **Fixed: Scrolling within panels no longer triggers story navigation** - panels now have proper scroll isolation
- **Fixed: Viewer column scroll interference** - Universal Viewer zoom/pan now works without triggering step changes
- **Improved keyboard navigation**: ↑/↓ for steps, ←/→ for panels, Escape to close
- **Click outside to close**: Panels close when clicking on darkened backdrop
- **Better visual feedback**: Subtle dark backdrop extends beyond viewport during panel focus
- Based on initial implementation by Sanjana Bhupathi

#### Objects Page Ordering
- **Fixed: Demo objects now appear after user objects** - prevents demo content from cluttering the top of the objects index page

#### CSV Comment Line Handling
- **Fixed: Quoted comment lines now properly filtered** - handles Google Sheets CSV export format where cells containing commas are quoted

### Changed

#### Generated Files Architecture
- **Gitignore improvements**: Generated files (`_data/*.json`, `_jekyll-files/`) now ignored by git
- **Single source of truth**: Only source files (CSVs, markdown) tracked in version control

### Changed

#### Flattened Image Directory Structure
- **Removed subdirectories**: `components/images/objects/` and `components/images/additional/` → `components/images/`
- **Updated default paths** in csv_to_json.py, generate_iiif.py, and validation
- **Automated migration** via upgrade script

#### CSV-Driven IIIF Tile Generation
- **Changed from directory-based to CSV-driven**: Only processes objects in `objects.csv` without external manifests
- **Automatic file detection** by `object_id` supporting multiple extensions (case-insensitive)
- **Faster generation** with no orphaned tiles

#### Unified source_url Column Name

- **Deleted docs/google_sheets_integration/** folder - fully documented in official docs site

### Fixed

#### CRITICAL: v0.4.0 Feature Restoration (Phase 1 - Data Pipeline)
- **Restored 1,382 lines** accidentally deleted from `csv_to_json.py` in commit f62acee (Nov 8, 2025)
- **Root cause**: Commit overwrote file, removing core v0.4.0 functionality
- **Features restored**:
  - Widget processing (~350 lines): accordion, carousel, tabs with Bootstrap HTML generation
  - IIIF metadata auto-population (~400 lines): extracts title, creator, period, location, credit
  - Glossary auto-linking (~150 lines): `[[term_id]]` syntax processing
  - Multilingual support (~100 lines): language string loading and interpolation
- **Applied v0.5.0 updates** to restored code (version header, flattened image paths)

#### CRITICAL: v0.4.0 Feature Restoration (Phase 2 - Display Components)
- **Restored frontend components** for widgets and glossary (~115 lines total)
- **Widget panel-specific styling**: Layer 1 widgets use Layer 2 colors and vice versa
- **Enhanced glossary functionality**: Proper title extraction, both inline and index links work
- **Widget initialization**: Added widgets.js script tag
- **Glossary multilingual support**: Language-aware panel labels and "Key term:" prefix

#### Layer 2 Panel Heading Colors
- **Fixed h2, h3, h4 color inheritance** in layer 2 panels (white on dark purple background)

#### Glossary Warning Message Clarity
- **Improved error message formatting** for missing glossary terms with quoted, bold term IDs
- **Added file path context** showing exactly which markdown file contains the broken reference
- **Natural sentence structure** replaces technical phrasing for better readability
- **Example**: "In the file stories/story2/step4-layer2.md, you reference the glossary term 'term', but this term does not exist in components/texts/glossary/"
- Files modified: `scripts/csv_to_json.py`, `_data/languages/en.yml`, `_data/languages/es.yml`

### Migration

- **Automated v0.4.x → v0.5.0 migration**:
  - File relocation: old subdirectories → `components/images/`
  - CSV column update: `iiif_manifest` → `source_url`
  - Name conflict detection and empty directory cleanup
- **Full backward compatibility**: No breaking changes for existing sites

---

## [0.4.3-beta] - 2025-11-15

### Fixed

#### v0.4.1 Migration Script Comment Restoration
- **Complete framework comments restored**: Migration now restores all missing comments in _config.yml
- **Top header comments**: Framework title and GitHub URL now restored at file beginning
- **Complete testing-features section**: Entire section created if missing (not just comments)
- **Impact**: Sites upgrading from v0.3.4 through multiple versions now have complete config structure

## [0.4.2-beta] - 2025-11-09

### Added

#### Smart IIIF Change Detection
- **Automatic optimization**: Build workflow now intelligently detects when IIIF tile regeneration is needed
- **Git diff-based detection**: Compares changed files between commits to determine if images or objects.csv changed
- **Manual override**: Workflow dispatch includes "Force IIIF tile regeneration" checkbox (default: checked for safety)
- **Multiple failsafes**: Defaults to full build on first commit, detection errors, or uncertain cases
- **GitHub Actions caching**: IIIF tiles cached between builds to prevent deletion when skipping regeneration
- **Cache key strategy**: Automatically invalidates cache when image files change using hash-based keys
- **Time savings**: Faster deployments for content-only changes (stories, text, metadata)
- **User experience**: Silent optimization for automatic builds, explicit control for manual triggers

**How it works**:
- Automatic builds (push to main): Detects file changes, skips IIIF if only content changed
- Manual builds: User checkbox to skip IIIF regeneration (safe default always regenerates)
- Cache system: Tiles saved after generation, restored when skipping, automatically invalidated on image changes

**Technical details**:
- Detection step runs before IIIF generation
- Checks `git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD` for changed files
- Triggers IIIF when: images in `components/images/objects/` or `objects.csv` changed
- Skips IIIF when: Only content files changed (stories, glossary, configs, layouts, etc.)
- Cache operations: restore → generate (if needed) → save → restore to _site (if skipped)

### Fixed

#### CRITICAL: IIIF Tile Deletion When Skipping Regeneration
- **Root cause identified**: GitHub Actions workflows are ephemeral - each run starts fresh with no IIIF tiles
- **Problem**: Skipping IIIF generation left `_site/iiif/objects/` empty, deployment replaced entire site, deleting live tiles
- **Solution**: GitHub Actions cache system preserves tiles between workflow runs
- **Cache strategy**:
  - Restore cache after Jekyll build
  - Generate and cache tiles (if needed)
  - Restore cached tiles to `_site/` when skipping regeneration
  - Cache key based on image directory hash for automatic invalidation
- **Safety features**: Warns if cache unavailable, logs all cache operations, fails gracefully
- **Testing**: Confirmed working on demo site (ampl.clair.ucsb.edu/telar)
- **Impact**: Critical fix prevents tile deletion, enables safe optimization

#### Mobile Navbar Title Wrapping
- Long site titles now wrap naturally on mobile devices instead of overflowing or being cut off
- Hamburger menu right-aligned for better mobile UX
- Flexbox properties adjusted for proper text flow on small screens

#### Mobile Font Size Adjustments
- Added `white-space: normal` to allow proper text wrapping
- Reduced display-4 font size on mobile for better readability
- Works in conjunction with existing height-based responsive design

#### Site Title Wrapping on Mobile
- CSS rules added to enable proper text wrapping for site titles
- Ensures titles display cleanly across all mobile screen sizes
- Tested with various title lengths on different devices

#### Site Description Link Styling
- Fixed link styling on home page for consistent appearance
- Proper theme color application to site description links

### Changed
- Build workflow now includes smart IIIF detection and caching (4 new steps, ~76 lines added)
- Migration framework updated with `README.md` and `index.html` for complete v0.4.1 upgrades

---

## [0.4.1-beta] - 2025-11-08

### Fixed

#### CRITICAL: Upgrade Script Comment Deletion
- **Migration script bug fixed**: v0.3.4→v0.4.0 migration was deleting ALL comments from `_config.yml`
- **GitHub Actions workflow bug fixed**: Workflow was using `yaml.dump()` which stripped all comments after migration
- **Comment restoration added**: v0.4.0→v0.4.1 migration now detects and restores 13 types of missing comments
- **Comments restored**: Site Settings, Story Interface, PLEASE DO NOT EDIT warning, Collections, Build Settings, Defaults, Telar Settings, Plugins, WEBrick, Development & Testing, Christmas Tree Mode, and all setup instructions
- Root cause: `_ensure_google_sheets_comments()` in v034_to_v040.py used destructive `while loop + pop()` pattern
- Secondary cause: Workflow step "Update version in _config.yml" used `yaml.safe_load()` + `yaml.dump()` after migrations
- Impact: Users upgrading from v0.3.4 to v0.4.0 lost all documentation in their config files
- **Note for users**: After upgrading to v0.4.1, you need to update your `.github/workflows/upgrade.yml` file ONCE (see upgrade instructions)

#### CRITICAL: Mobile Responsive Features Restored
- **Complete mobile code recovery**: Restored ~1,300 lines of mobile responsive code accidentally lost in v0.4.0 release
- **Height-based responsive design**: 4-tier progressive system for small screens (Tiers 1-3: 700px, 667px, 600px height breakpoints)
- **Mobile panel UI**: Fixed-size panels with stacking visibility and proper viewport positioning
- **Graceful panel transitions**: Navigation cooldown, skeleton shimmer loading, fade-only transitions on mobile
- **Mobile preloading**: Aggressive ±2 step preloading on mobile, enhanced 3/2 forward/backward on desktop
- **Offcanvas adjustments**: Progressive typography and spacing reductions for small screens
- **Site-wide scaling**: Consistent mobile experience across all pages
- Root cause: Upstream merge in commit f62acee overwrote local mobile development
- Impact: Major regression fix - restores complete mobile UX from v0.4.0

### Added

#### Object Gallery Mobile Layout
- **Responsive breakpoints**: Single column layout up to 441px width, two columns from 442px-768px
- **Explicit column control**: Replaced auto-fill grid behavior with explicit column counts for predictable mobile layout
- **iPhone Pro Max optimization**: 440px width devices display single column for optimal readability
- **Removed conflicting rules**: Fixed 576px media query that was overriding mobile breakpoints

#### Coordinate Picker Improvements
- **Sheets copy button**: New button in coordinate picker that copies tab-separated values (x\ty\tzoom) for direct pasting into Google Sheets
- **CSV copy button**: Renamed existing button to "x, y, zoom (CSV)" for clarity
- **Button order**: Sheets button first (primary workflow), CSV button second
- **Multilingual support**: Button labels and "Copied!" feedback respect `telar_language` setting
- Both buttons provide visual feedback ("Copied!" / "¡Copiado!")

### Changed
- Coordinate picker now has two copy buttons instead of one, with clear labels indicating format
- Coordinate picker buttons are now fully multilingual (English/Spanish)

  - Added `font-weight: 400 !important` to `.telar-alert` CSS class to prevent lighter font weight inheritance from `.page-content` wrapper
  - Ensures all validation warnings (theme, Google Sheets, objects, stories, IIIF URL, upgrade) display with consistent typography regardless of HTML placement

## [0.3.3-beta] - 2025-10-28

### Fixed

- **GitHub Actions workflow**: Removed git push step that conflicted with branch protection rules. The workflow was attempting to commit generated files back to the protected main branch, causing deployment failures. Generated files are build artifacts that don't need to be committed to the repository.

## [0.3.2-beta] - 2025-10-28

### Added

- **Image sizing in panel markdown**: New syntax `![alt](path){size}` for controlling image sizes in panel content
  - Supports both short (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `full`) and long (`small`, `medium`, `large`) size names

    - Columns with names starting with `#` (e.g., `# Instructions`, `# Notes`) are ignored during JSON conversion
    - Template includes `# Instructions` column with examples for user guidance
- **Comprehensive error messaging system**: User-friendly warnings displayed on index, objects, and story pages when configuration issues are detected
- **Object ID validation**: Automatic stripping of file extensions from object IDs and warnings for spaces in filenames
- **IIIF manifest validation**: Full validation of external IIIF manifests with detailed error messages
- **Thumbnail validation**: Automatic detection and clearing of invalid thumbnail values (placeholders, non-image files)
- **Build-time warnings**: Console logging with structured [INFO] and [WARN] messages during CSV to JSON conversion

- **Theme system**: Flexible theming system with 4 preset themes and support for custom themes
  - Preset themes: Paisajes Coloniales (default), Neogranadina, Santa Barbara, and Austin
  - Easy theme switching via `_config.yml` with single-line configuration
  - Customizable colors (primary, secondary, panel backgrounds) and fonts (headings, body)
  - Advanced users can create `_data/themes/custom.yml` for fully custom themes (gitignored by default)
  - Dynamic CSS generation using SCSS with Liquid templating

### Fixed

- **Error message clarity**: All user-facing errors reference "configuration CSV or Google Sheet" for clarity
- **Object warning field**: Added object_warning to Jekyll collection frontmatter for template access
- **Objects CSV column order**: Moved iiif_manifest to position 4 (after description) for better visibility and logical grouping
- **Story CSV column order**: Reordered columns to group related fields - object and coordinates (x, y, zoom) now appear at start after step number, followed by question/answer, then panel configuration
- **Story intro layout**: Intro slide now appears in the narrative column (left side) instead of full-screen, with step 1's viewer visible immediately on the right for a cleaner, more consistent experience
- **Glossary page styling**: Glossary term links now use theme link colors and body font for consistent theming
- **Glossary navigation**: Clicking glossary terms on the glossary index page now opens a slide-over panel instead of navigating to separate pages, providing a smoother browsing experience
  - Panels slide away and then back in when switching between terms for smooth transitions
  - Glossary panels are narrower than story layer 2 panels (45% vs 55%) for clear visual hierarchy
  - Back button added to glossary panel header for easy dismissal, matching story panel design
- **Theme fallback system**: Multi-tier protection against theme configuration errors
  - Three types of error detection: missing theme, malformed YAML, or critical system failure
  - Automatic fallback to paisajes (default) theme when configured theme is unavailable
  - Protected fallback copy in `scripts/defaults/themes/` as ultimate backup
  - Hardcoded CSS defaults ensure site functions even if all theme files are damaged
  - User-friendly warning messages on index page explain issues and suggest fixes

### Removed

- **Deprecated glossary CSV workflow**: Glossary feature now sources content exclusively from markdown files in `_glossary/`. CSV-based glossary input has been removed.
- **Non-functional project.csv fields**: Removed `primary_color`, `secondary_color`, `font_headings`, and `font_body` from `project.csv` (these values were not being used by templates). Theme customization now handled via the new theme system in `_data/themes/`.

## [0.2.0-beta] - 2025-10-20

### Changed

- **Scrolling system overhaul**: Replaced Scrollama library with custom discrete step-based card stacking architecture to enable **multiple IIIF objects within a single story**. Each object gets its own preloaded viewer card that slides up/down as users navigate through steps.
- **Animation timing**: Reduced viewer pan/zoom animation duration from 36 seconds to 4 seconds for more natural pacing
- **Cleaner viewer UI**: Hidden UniversalViewer color picker and adjustment panels for distraction-free viewing

### Fixed

- **Critical navigation bug**: Fixed viewer cards getting stuck or invisible after backward→forward navigation cycles
- **Z-index layering**: Resolved issue where reused viewer cards appeared behind currently visible cards
- **State management**: Added complete state reset when reusing viewer cards (clears inline styles, transitions, opacity)
- **Intro handling**: Improved viewer reference management when navigating to/from story intro
